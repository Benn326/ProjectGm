# Special Hangman Game

A unique twist on the classic Hangman game!

## ðŸŽ® Versions
- **v1.0**: ONLY code in C++, no graphics.  
- **v1.1**: Added basic graphics, plays like a regular Hangman game.  
- **v2.0**: Special mechanic â€“ each wrong guess cuts a rope. After 6 mistakes, no ropes left â†’ game over!

## ðŸš€ How to Play
1. Guess the hidden word letter by letter.  
2. Each wrong guess cuts a rope holding the stickman.  
3. If all 6 ropes are cut, the stickman falls, and you lose.  

Stay sharp and save the stickman! ðŸª¢ðŸ’€  

## ðŸ”§ Future Plans
- Add sound effects.  
- Implement different difficulty levels.
